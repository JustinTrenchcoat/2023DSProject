# 2023DSProject

This is the repo for my research project back in 2023. It is a project about Sea Surface Salinity and Sea Surface Temperature at Southwestern Atlantic Ocean region.
A research paper was written but not published. 
Dr. Anastasia Romanou from Columbia University was the supervisor of this project and she can prove that those code were written back in 2023.

In the paper *A Study of the Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Surface Salinity Regimes in the Southern Atlantic Ocean*, I was mainly in charge of Literature Review, Conclusion and Discussion. I helped in composing the clustering algoprithm and graphing code as well. 

A plan for converting the data analysis code into R/Python is on the way.
